 * Class APIFunction
 * Represent a function in an endpoint of an API
 *
 * ### Example
 * Suppose than you have a manager ases_user_api.php, and you want two functions over user, get a moodle user
 * as json related with the ases_user_id given, also you want get the socioeconomic information of a given user,
 * bot functions under ases_user_api.php but you want access the information separately
 * For make this, you need two API functions, get_mdl_user and get_socioeconomic_info, each function need at least
 * the ases user id as an input, then you can create two API functions:
 *
 * get_mdl_user = APIFunction(
